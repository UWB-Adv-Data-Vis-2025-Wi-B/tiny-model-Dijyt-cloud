##Introdution 

This R Markdown document demonstrates my ability to build linear models for data analysis using the diamonds dataset from the ggplot2 package. The goal is to predict a diamond's price based on its characteristics.

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(diamonds, package = "ggplot2")
names(diamonds)
```
